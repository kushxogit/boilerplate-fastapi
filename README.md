# Welcome to the Project Onboarding Document

**Welcome aboard!** Please follow these steps to set up your development environment.

Repository:

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Install Python 3.11.x**
    Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed on your machine.

2.  **Check if pip is installed**
    Confirm pip installation by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```shell
    pip --version

    ```

3.  **Install Required Packages**
    Install all the necessary packages using pip by executing:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Note: The requirements.txt file can be found in our project directory.

4.  **Run the Application**
    To start the application, use the following command:

         cd /backend  
         uvicorn main:app --reload

# Understand the Project Structure

Please familiarize yourself with the files listed below, in the order provided. Each file includes comments explaining its purpose and usage.

I have structured our project into two modules: src and test:

```
└── backend/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── config/
    │   ├── routes/
    │   ├── util/
    │   └── __init__.py
    ├── test/
    │   ├── routes/
    │   ├── test_util/
    │   ├── __init.py__
    │   ├── app_test.py
    │   └── conftest.py
    ├── main.py
    └── requirements.txt
```

# Test module: TBD(To be done)

# File Descriptions

## Backend Main Entry Point

# Folder Structure & Descriptions for backend/src/routes/auth

## internal/

Description: Houses internal logic for authentication, such as user data fetching and JWT token handling.

## rest_api/

Description: Contains the API endpoints for authentication services like login and token verification.

## store/

Description: Includes the data models and schemas used for authentication, featuring MongoDB document models and Pydantic validation schemas.

# For Backend Development, We will be focusing on the folder `routes` below

```

- Description: Manages JWT token creation and decoding.
- Generalized Responsibilities: Responsible for writing data, specifically creating and managing tokens.

## Authentication Endpoints - REST API

- Path: `backend/src/routes/auth/rest_api/auth_controller.py`
- File Name: `auth_controller.py`
- Description: Hosts API endpoints for authentication, including login and token verification.
- Generalized Responsibilities: Serves as the interface for HTTP requests handling authentication processes.

## Authentication Data Models and Schemas

- Path: `backend/src/routes/auth/store/auth_models.py`
- File Name: `auth_models.py`
- Description: Defines MongoDB document models for user credentials.
- Generalized Responsibilities: Defines the structure of data for storage and retrieval.

- Path: `backend/src/routes/auth/store/auth_schemas.py`
- File Name: `auth_schemas.py`
